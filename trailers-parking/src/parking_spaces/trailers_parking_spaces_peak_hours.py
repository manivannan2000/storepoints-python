To calculate peak utilization hours, we need to determine the hours when the maximum number of trailers
are in parking spaces. This involves tracking when trailers arrive and leave, and counting how many trailers
are in parking spaces during each hour.

Modified Solution
Hereâ€™s the updated solution with a calculation for peak utilization hours:

Explanation
Track Parking Utilization by Time:

For each trailer's stay, calculate the range of hours from arrival_time to departure_time.
Increment the trailer count for each hour during this range.
Calculate Peak Utilization:

Use a dictionary (hour_usage) to track the number of trailers in parking spaces for each hour.
Determine the maximum number of trailers present in any single hour (max_utilization).
Find Peak Hours:

Identify all hours where the trailer count equals the maximum utilization.
Output:

Display the peak utilization and the corresponding hours.

How it Works
At 12:00:

Trailer t1 arrives (p1).
Trailer t2 arrives (p2).
Total: 2 trailers.
At 13:00:

Both trailers are still parked.
Total: 2 trailers.
At 14:00:

Only t2 is parked.
Total: 1 trailer.
The peak utilization of 2 trailers occurs during the hours starting at 12:00 and 13:00.

Customizations
You can:

Extend the solution to group peak hours by yards.
Add visualization for utilization trends using libraries like matplotlib.
Modify time granularity (e.g., use 30-minute intervals).
